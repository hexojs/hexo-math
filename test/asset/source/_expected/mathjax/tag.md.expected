<p>This equation <span>$\cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta =  2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$</span><!-- Has MathJax --> is inline.<br>This used to cause problem: <span>$\frac{|ax + by + c|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->.</p>
<p>This should be rendered as block:<br><span>$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
